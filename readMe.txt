##What Should I See This Week

Are you overwhelmed by the number of art exhibitions in your city? Would 
you like to randomly choose one to see, thereby getting you out of your 
comfort zone, and taking the onus for choosing a "decent" or "cool" show 
out of your hands entirely? Well, you are in luck!

WSISTW is a art exhibition randomizer inspired by wtfsigte.comw (Where the 
Fuck Should I Go to Eat) and drawing on an external API.

You provide your city, and our randomizer will choose a show for you to see.
Don't like what we picked? Choose again. 
Want to go see the show? Version 2 of WSISTW will enable location and maps.
